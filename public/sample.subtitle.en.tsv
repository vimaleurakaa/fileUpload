860	2580	I've got a confession.
2580	5812	I love looking through people's garbage.
5812	7741	Now, it's not some creepy thing.
7741	9931	I'm usually just looking for old electronics,
9931	12381	stuff I can take to my workshop and hack.
12381	16044	I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.
16044	18677	Each one's got three different motors,
18677	20638	so now you can build things that move.
20638	23377	There's switches so you can turn things on and off.
23377	25259	There's even a freaking laser,
25259	30778	so you can make a cool robot into an awesome robot.
30778	33968	Now, I've built a lot of stuff out of garbage,
33968	36773	and some of these things have even been kind of useful.
36773	37982	But here's the thing,
37982	40607	for me, garbage is just a chance to play,
40607	43554	to be creative and build things to amuse myself.
43554	47214	This is what I love doing, so I just made it part of my day job.
47214	49795	I lead a university-based biological research lab,
49795	53756	where we value curiosity and exploration above all else.
53756	56376	We aren't focused on any particular problem,
56376	58962	and we're not trying to solve any particular disease.
58962	61670	This is just a place where people can come
61670	65470	and ask fascinating questions and find answers.
65470	67359	And I realized a long time ago
67359	70625	that if I challenge people to build the equipment they need
70625	72762	out of the garbage I find,
72762	75549	it's a great way to foster creativity.
75549	76724	And what happened
76724	79629	was that artists and scientists from around the world
79629	81669	started coming to my lab.
81669	84902	And it's not just because we value unconventional ideas,
84902	87244	it's because we test and validate them
87244	89620	with scientific rigor.
89620	93545	So one day I was hacking something, I was taking it apart,
93545	95426	and I had this sudden idea:
95426	98889	Could I treat biology like hardware?
98889	101164	Could I dismantle a biological system,
101164	102611	mix and match the parts
102611	105946	and then put it back together in some new and creative way?
105946	108054	My lab started working on this,
108054	111601	and I want to show you the result.
111601	115278	Can any of you guys tell me what fruit this is?
115278	116453	Audience: Apple!
116453	118634	Andrew Pelling: That's right -- it's an apple.
118634	120657	Now, I actually want you to notice as well
120657	124294	that this is a lot redder than most apples.
124294	127044	And that's because we grew human cells into it.
127044	131246	We took a totally innocent Macintosh apple,
131246	134289	removed all the apple cells and DNA
134289	136332	and then implanted human cells.
136332	139405	And what we're left with after removing all the apple cells
139405	141170	is this cellulose scaffold.
141170	144331	This is the stuff that gives plants their shape and texture.
144331	146327	And these little holes that you can see,
146327	149254	this is where all the apple cells used to be.
149254	150462	So then we come along,
150462	153548	we implant some mammalian cells that you can see in blue.
153548	155780	What happens is, these guys start multiplying
155780	158414	and they fill up this entire scaffold.
158414	160775	As weird as this is,
160775	164955	it's actually really reminiscent of how our own tissues are organized.
164955	167232	And we found in our pre-clinical work
167232	169652	that you can implant these scaffolds into the body,
169652	172359	and the body will send in cells and a blood supply
172359	175348	and actually keep these things alive.
175348	178469	This is the point when people started asking me,
178469	183794	"Andrew, can you make body parts out of apples?"
183794	186049	And I'm like, "You've come to the right place."
186049	187715	(Laughter)
187715	189924	I actually brought this up with my wife.
189924	191682	She's a musical instrument maker,
191682	194529	and she does a lot of wood carving for a living.
194529	196865	So I asked her,
196865	200126	"Could you, like, literally carve some ears
200126	201682	out of an apple for us?"
201682	203157	And she did.
203157	205953	So I took her ears to the lab.
205953	208979	We then started preparing them.
208979	210340	Yeah, I know.
210340	213397	(Laughter)
213397	215139	It's a good lab, man.
215139	216624	(Laughter)
216624	219008	And then we grew cells on them.
219008	221916	And this is the result.
221916	227778	Listen, my lab is not in the ear-manufacturing business.
227778	231138	People have actually been working on this for decades.
231138	232810	Here's the issue:
232810	237240	commercial scaffolds can be really expensive and problematic,
237240	239865	because they're sourced from proprietary products,
239865	247259	animals or cadavers.
247259	250873	We used an apple and it cost pennies.
250873	252934	What's also really cool here
252934	255103	is it's not that hard to make these things.
255103	258059	The equipment you need can be built from garbage,
258059	262866	and the key processing step only requires soap and water.
262866	267393	So what we did was put all the instructions online as open source.
267393	269553	And then we founded a mission-driven company,
269553	271955	and we're developing kits to make it easier
271955	274550	for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron
274550	276132	to make these things at home.
276132	280229	What I'm really curious about is if one day,
280229	285504	it will be possible to repair, rebuild and augment our own bodies
285504	289321	with stuff we make in the kitchen.
289321	291442	Speaking of kitchens,
291442	293402	here's some asparagus.
293402	296109	They're tasty, and they make your pee smell funny.
296109	297386	(Laughter)
297386	300033	Now, I was in my kitchen, and I was noticing
300033	302643	that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus,
302643	305658	what you can see are all these tiny little vessels.
305658	307331	And when we image them in the lab,
307331	310832	you can see how the cellulose forms these structures.
310832	313701	This image reminds me of two things:
313701	315607	our blood vessels
315607	319854	and the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord.
319854	321860	So here's the question:
321860	326064	Can we grow axons and neurons down these channels?
326064	327714	Because if we can,
327714	332005	then maybe we can use asparagus to form new connections
332005	335627	between the ends of damaged and severed nerves.
335627	338126	Or maybe even a spinal cord.
338126	339436	Don't get me wrong --
339436	341464	this is exceptionally challenging
341464	343083	and really hard work to do,
343083	346116	and we are not the only ones working on this.
346116	349080	But we are the only ones using asparagus.
349080	352060	(Laughter)
352060	355202	Right now, we've got really promising pilot data.
355202	357109	And we're working with tissue engineers
357109	358299	and neurosurgeons
358299	360793	to find out what's actually possible.
360793	363371	So listen, all of the work I've shown you,
363371	366588	the stuff that I've built that's all around me on this stage
366588	369282	and the other projects my lab is involved in
369282	373393	are all a direct result of me playing with your garbage.
373393	379454	Play -- play is a key part of my scientific practice.
379454	383462	It's how I train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative
383462	386491	and to decide to make human apple ears.
386491	391166	So, the next time any of you are looking at some old,
391166	395769	broken-down, malfunctioning, piece-of-crap technology,
395769	398199	I want you to think of me.
398199	399381	Because I want it.
399381	400556	(Laughter)
400556	404587	Seriously, please find any way to get in touch with me,
404587	406552	and let's see what we can build.
406552	407727	Thank you.
407727	407727	(Applause)
